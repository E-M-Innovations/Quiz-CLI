This documentation page outlines a project designed to streamline the administration of multiple-choice assessments using TOML-formatted test files. The project includes a main script, utility modules, and test folders containing the test files. Its objective is to simplify the process of designing, organizing, and executing tests by leveraging TOML files. The project offers flexibility in customizing tests, organization of tests into folders, randomization of questions, interactivity for user engagement, and automated evaluation of answers.

The plan involves using the existing CLI project as a foundation and building a web interface using the FASTAPI framework. The web interface will allow users to take tests and view their results in real-time. The ultimate goal is to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users while maintaining the flexibility and customization options of the original CLI project.
